## What is this file for?
You will find here a **graphical explanation** of the system I am using to structure my code and filing system.

This resource could be useful for any external reviewer.

My current file system (as of 6th August)
 Splitted the script in "dialogues", "decorators", "db interactions" and "utils" - which will then be imported 
modules withiin the app's main.py final file
